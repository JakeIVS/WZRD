# WZRD
WZRD is a virtual spellbook CLI for D&D 5th edition. It allows you to save learned spells to your spell list, create custom spells, and manage character stats.

#Getting Started
Begin by running ./seed.py
This will fetch data from the DnD 5e API and create a local database needed to run the program.
If you run into any issues with the database and need to seed it again, make sure you delete the previous database file before running ./seed.py again
